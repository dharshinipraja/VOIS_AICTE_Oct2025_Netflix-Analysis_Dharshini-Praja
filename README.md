# 🎬 Netflix Content Trends Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores Netflix’s content catalog to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help guide strategic decisions.  
The dataset consists of over 7,000 titles — both Movies and TV Shows — containing information about title, director, cast, country, release date, rating, duration, and genres.

The goal is to understand:
- How Netflix’s content library has evolved over time  
- Which countries and genres dominate the platform  
- How the balance between Movies and TV Shows has shifted over the years

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of Movies vs TV Shows  
- Visualize content growth over time  
- Identify top contributing countries to Netflix’s catalog  
- Explore popular genres and their relative frequencies  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for future content planning
